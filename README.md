# DHT11Webserver.github.io
Interface DHT11 with ESP32 &amp; Display Values Using Web Server

This project employs the ESP32 as the control device, which connects to an existing WiFi network and creates a Web Server. When a device connects to this web server, the ESP32 will read the temperature and relative humidity from the DHT11/DHT22 sensor and send it to the deviceâ€™s web browser with a nice interface.
